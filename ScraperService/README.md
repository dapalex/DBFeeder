# DBFeeder - Scraper

_The development is in progress as well as the documentation_

This is the service in charge of extracting information from an url received from the [_Crawler_](https://github.com/dapalex/DBFeeder/blob/main/CrawlerService) and passing it to the [_DAC_](https://github.com/dapalex/DBFeeder/blob/main/DACService) via Event Bus.
It listens from the queue in the Event Bus generated by the Crawler and:

- Fetches the destination URL
- Navigate through the page
- Finds the target containers
- Extract the structured information
- Generate the Entity object from the extracted information

## Design

This service is multi-process, a process for each configuration file present in the configs folder.
